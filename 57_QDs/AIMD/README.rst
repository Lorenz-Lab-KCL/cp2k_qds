AIMD for Magic InP_QDs
=========================


This input has been tested in Young for CP2K. For ARCHER2, please change the basis set and potential paths. I think, that the number of cores should 
be reduced to something around to 1-2 nodes (128-256 cores). This is at 1200 K and it is presenting the same behavior as the other ones. Temperature
us decaying and then it needs to be thermalised for a long time. 

The main goal in this case is to get the structure thermalized to 1200K.
