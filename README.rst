Introduction to CP2k using InP Quantum Dots
==============================================

In this repository, different examples for cp2k inputs can be found to perform, single point calculations, geometry relaxations 
and AIMD calculations (NVT at 300K) using a simple InP model. This repository is intended to have templates for users that would 
like to use this program to perform *ab-initio* calculations.
